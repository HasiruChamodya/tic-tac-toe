# 🎮 Classic Console Tic-Tac-Toe (C++)

**A nostalgic look back at my Level 1 University coding days!**

This repository contains a classic, fully playable 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++ for the Windows command prompt. I wrote this during my first year of university as a way to practice fundamental programming concepts like 2D arrays, game loops, conditionals, and basic UI manipulation. 

## ✨ Features
* **Interactive Main Menu:** Easy navigation to start a game, view the rules, or exit.
* **Custom Console UI:** Utilizes the `<windows.h>` library to add text colors and screen-clearing functionality for a cleaner, arcade-like experience.
* **Two-Player Mode:** Allows custom name inputs for Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
* **Robust Win/Draw Detection:** Accurately calculates rows, columns, and diagonals to declare a winner or identify a stalemate.

## 🚀 How to Run (Windows Only)
Because this project uses the `<windows.h>` library for console color manipulation and screen clearing, it is designed specifically for Windows environments.
